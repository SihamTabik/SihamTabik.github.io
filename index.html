<h1> Hands-on lab: Build CNN-classifiers with TensorFlow </h1>

  <li><h2> Instalation</h2></li>
  
  <li><h2>My Hello World! example</h2></li>
      &bull; Read carefully convolutional.py
      &bull; Train LeNet-5-like convolutional Network on MNIST dabase
  <li><h2>Classify Imagenet</h2></li>
 
<xmp> cd models/tutorials/image/imagenet</xmp>
<xmp> python classify_image.py</xmp>
If the model runs correctly, the script will produce the top five classes with their respective scores.<br>
If you wish to supply other JPEG images, you may do so by editing the <xmp> --image_file </xmp> argument.<br>

If you download the model data to a different directory, you will need to point <xmp>--model_dir</xmp> to the directory used.<br>

  <li><h2>Finetuning GoogLeNet Final Layer on a New dataset</h2></li>
 Download new dataset <br>
       <table>
	<tr  bgcolor="#777777">
	<xmp> cd ~ </xmp>
       <xmp> curl -O http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz </xmp>
       <xmp> tar xzf flower_photos.tgz </xmp> </font>
	</tr>
</table>
 Download retrain.py   <br>   
       <xmp> cd  ~/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/examples/ </xmp>
       <xmp> mkdir image_retraining </xmp>
       <xmp> curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/r1.1/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py </xmp>
 Have a look at retrain.py and costumize where you want to download the GoogLeNet, also called Inception model, bottelneck, . By default the model is downloaded in /tmp. 
        <xmp> python retrain.py --image_dir ~/flower_photos {add your args here} </xmp>
This script loads the pre-trained GoogLeNet model, removes the old top FC layer, and trains a new one on the flower photos
 you've downloaded. None of the flower species were in the original ImageNet classes the full network was trained on. 
 The magic of transfer learning is that lower layers that have been trained to distinguish between some objects can be reused for many recognition tasks without any alteration.
