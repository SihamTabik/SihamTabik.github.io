<h1> Hands-on lab: Build CNN-classifiers with TensorFlow </h1>    
<ol>
  <li><h2> Instalation</h2></li>
  TensorFlow can be installed in Ubuntu, Mac and Windows (not sure about its stability).<br>
  &bull; Before installation one should have the answers to these questions: <br>
	 If you have 1) NVIDIAÂ® GPU with Compute Capability 3.0 or higher and 2) cuDNN v5.1 v3 or greater then you can install  tensorflow-gpu, which is basically a version of tensorflow prepared to run on NVIDIA GPUs.<br>
	
&bull;	Prerequisites 
  <li><h2>My Hello World! example</h2></li>
      &bull; Read carefully convolutional.py
      &bull; Train LeNet-5-like convolutional Network on MNIST dabase
  <li><h2>Classify Imagenet</h2></li>
 
<xmp> cd models/tutorials/image/imagenet</xmp>
<xmp> python classify_image.py</xmp>
If the model runs correctly, the script will produce the top five classes with their respective scores.<br>
If you wish to supply other JPEG images, you may do so by editing the <xmp> --image_file </xmp> argument.<br>

If you download the model data to a different directory, you will need to point <xmp>--model_dir</xmp> to the directory used.<br>

  <li><h2>Finetuning GoogLeNet Final Layer on a New dataset</h2></li>
 Download new dataset <br>
 <table>
   <tr  bgcolor="#CCFFFF"><td>
       <xmp> cd ~ </xmp>
       <xmp> curl -O http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz </xmp>
       <xmp> tar xzf flower_photos.tgz </xmp> </font>

	 </td>
   </tr>
</table>
 Download retrain.py   <br>   
<table>
   <tr  bgcolor="#CCFFFF"><td>	
       <xmp> cd  ~/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/examples/ </xmp>
       <xmp> mkdir image_retraining </xmp>
       <xmp> curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/r1.1/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py </xmp>
 	 </td>
   </tr>
</table>

	   Have a look at retrain.py and costumize where you want to download the GoogLeNet, also called Inception model, bottelneck, . By default the model is downloaded in /tmp. 
<table>
        <tr  bgcolor="#CCFFFF"><td>	
	<xmp> python retrain.py --image_dir ~/flower_photos {add your args here} </xmp>
	</td>
   </tr>
</table>	
This script 1) loads the pre-trained GoogLeNet model, 2) removes the old top FC layer, also called Bottleneck, and 3) trains a new one
on the flower photos you've downloaded. None of the flower species were in the original ImageNet classes the full network was
trained on.  The magic of transfer learning, also called fine-tuning, is that lower layers that have been trained to distinguish 
	between some objects can be reused for many recognition tasks without any alteration.
